## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document is a live register used to identify, analyze, track, and manage all potential risks that could negatively impact the "NetSuite Learning Path" project. The goal is to proactively address these risks to minimize their potential impact on the project's schedule, cost, and overall objectives.

### 1.2. Risk Management Process
The risk management process for this project follows these steps:
1.  **Identify:** Potential risks are identified and logged in this register.
2.  **Analyze:** Each risk is assessed for its probability of occurrence and its potential impact on the project. A risk score is calculated.
3.  **Plan Response:** For significant risks, a mitigation or response plan is developed.
4.  **Monitor & Control:** The register is reviewed regularly to track existing risks, identify new ones, and execute response plans as needed.

## 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

This matrix is used to determine the overall Risk Score based on its Probability and Impact.

| **Probability** | **Very Low (1)** | **Low (2)** | **Medium (3)** | **High (4)** | **Very High (5)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Very High (5)** | Medium (5) | High (10) | High (15) | Critical (20) | Critical (25) |
| **High (4)** | Low (4) | Medium (8) | High (12) | High (16) | Critical (20) |
| **Medium (3)** | Low (3) | Medium (6) | Medium (9) | High (12) | High (15) |
| **Low (2)** | Very Low (2) | Low (4) | Medium (6) | Medium (8) | High (10) |
| **Very Low (1)** | Very Low (1) | Very Low (2) | Low (3) | Low (4) | Medium (5) |

**Risk Score Key:**
*   **1-4 (Very Low):** Acceptable risk, monitor.
*   **5-9 (Low):** Monitor closely.
*   **10-16 (Medium):** Active management required.
*   **17-25 (High/Critical):** Immediate action and mitigation plan required.

## 3. Risk Register

| Risk ID | Date Identified | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Risk Owner | Mitigation / Response Plan | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-001** | [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Sandbox/Dev Account Unavailability:** Access to a NetSuite sandbox account is lost or becomes unreliable, blocking all practical learning and development. | Resource | Low (2) | Very High (5) | 10 (Medium) | [Your Name] | **Mitigation:** Research alternative free developer account options. **Contingency:** Shift focus temporarily to non-platform-specific skills (e.g., advanced JavaScript, integration theory). | Open |
| **R-002** | [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Underestimation of Complexity:** A key topic (e.g., Map/Reduce scripts, CI/CD setup) is significantly more complex than estimated, causing schedule delays. | Schedule | High (4) | Medium (3) | 12 (High) | [Your Name] | **Mitigation:** Add a 20% contingency buffer to all estimates. Break down large tasks into smaller spikes to de-risk them early. Seek advice from mentors on complex topics. | Open |
| **R-003** | [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Loss of Motivation / Burnout:** The self-directed nature of the project leads to a loss of momentum, procrastination, or burnout, extending the timeline indefinitely. | Resource | Medium (3) | High (4) | 12 (High) | [Your Name] | **Mitigation:** Adhere to a strict weekly schedule. Share progress publicly or with a mentor to create accountability. Schedule planned breaks and downtime. | Open |
| **R-004** | [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Key Learning Resource Becomes Obsolete:** A primary online course or tutorial series becomes outdated or is taken down, creating a gap in the learning plan. | Technical | Low (2) | Medium (3) | 6 (Medium) | [Your Name] | **Mitigation:** Do not rely on a single source for any topic. Cross-reference key information with official NetSuite documentation. | Open |
| **R-005** | [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Scope Creep:** The scope of portfolio projects expands beyond the initial plan, consuming extra time and delaying completion of the core learning objectives. | Scope | Medium (3) | Medium (3) | 9 (Medium) | [Your Name] | **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the FSD and TSD for each project. Log all "nice-to-have" ideas in a separate backlog to be addressed only after the primary goals are met. | Open |
| **R-006** | [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Technical Environment Issues:** Significant time is lost dealing with local development environment issues (e.g., tooling conflicts, OS updates breaking tools). | Technical | Medium (3) | Low (2) | 6 (Medium) | [Your Name] | **Mitigation:** Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for development tools where possible to create a stable, reproducible environment. Document setup steps carefully. | Open |

## 4. Definitions

### 4.1. Risk Categories
*   **Technical:** Risks related to the technology, tools, and platforms being used.
*   **Schedule:** Risks that could impact the project timeline and milestones.
*   **Scope:** Risks related to the project's scope being changed or ill-defined.
*   **Resource:** Risks related to the availability and performance of necessary resources (people, accounts, tools).
*   **Cost:** Risks that could impact the project budget.

### 4.2. Probability Scale
| Level | Score | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Very High** | 5 | Almost certain to occur (>80% probability). |
| **High** | 4 | Likely to occur (61-80% probability). |
| **Medium** | 3 | May occur (41-60% probability). |
| **Low** | 2 | Unlikely to occur (21-40% probability). |
| **Very Low** | 1 | Rare to occur (<20% probability). |

### 4.3. Impact Scale
| Level | Score | Description (Schedule Impact) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Very High** | 5 | Causes a critical delay (>4 weeks) or failure to meet a primary project objective. |
| **High** | 4 | Causes a significant delay (2-4 weeks) to a major milestone. |
| **Medium** | 3 | Causes a noticeable delay (1-2 weeks) that requires schedule adjustments. |
| **Low** | 2 | Causes a minor delay (<1 week) that can be absorbed by the contingency buffer. |
| **Very Low** | 1 | Negligible impact on the schedule. |
