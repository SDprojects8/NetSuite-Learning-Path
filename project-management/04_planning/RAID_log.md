## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document is a live log to track the key **Risks**, **Assumptions**, **Issues**, and **Dependencies** (RAID) associated with the "NetSuite Learning Path" project. Its purpose is to provide a single, centralized place to manage these critical project elements, ensuring they are visible and actively managed throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1.2. How to Use This Log
*   **Risks:** Potential future events that could negatively impact the project.
*   **Assumptions:** Things held to be true for planning purposes, which if proven false, could become risks or issues.
*   **Issues:** Problems or roadblocks that are currently happening and require action.
*   **Dependencies:** Items the project needs from other parties or external sources to proceed.

This log should be reviewed regularly (e.g., weekly) to update statuses and add new items.
