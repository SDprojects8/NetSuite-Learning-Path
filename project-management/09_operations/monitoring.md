- **Examples**: Service down, data loss, security breach
- **Notification**: Page + Phone + Email + Slack

#### High (P2)
- **Response Time**: 30 minutes
- **Escalation**: After 1 hour
- **Examples**: Performance degradation, high error rate
- **Notification**: Email + Slack + Phone (if no response)

#### Medium (P3)
- **Response Time**: 2 hours
- **Escalation**: After 4 hours
- **Examples**: Non-critical service issues, capacity warnings
- **Notification**: Email + Slack

#### Low (P4)
- **Response Time**: Next business day
- **Escalation**: After 1 business day
- **Examples**: Informational, trend notifications
- **Notification**: Email
