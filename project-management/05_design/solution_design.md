This design serves as the primary guide for the implementation phase, ensuring that the developed system is scalable, maintainable, and aligned with the project's objectives.

### 1.2. Scope
The scope of this document covers the high-level architecture, detailed component design, data flow, key design decisions, and operational considerations for the project.

## 2. High-Level Solution Design

### 2.1. Conceptual Overview
The solution is a [describe the type of application, e.g., "scheduled, stateless integration service"] designed to [state the primary function, e.g., "synchronize customer data between Salesforce and NetSuite"]. The system will operate by [describe the core process, e.g., "periodically polling Salesforce for changes, transforming the data into the NetSuite format, and loading it into NetSuite via its REST API"]. The entire process is designed to be automated, resilient, and configurable.

### 2.2. Architectural Style
The chosen architectural style is **modular monolithic**. While the application runs as a single process, it is internally structured into distinct, loosely coupled components (services) with well-defined responsibilities. This approach provides a good balance of simplicity in deployment while promoting code organization and testability, which is ideal for a project of this scale.

## 3. Component Breakdown
The solution is broken down into the following logical components:

### 3.1. Component: Configuration Service
*   **Responsibility:** To load and provide access to all application settings, including API credentials, endpoints, and processing rules.
*   **Technology:** Python `python-dotenv` library.
*   **Interface:** A `Config` class that exposes settings as properties.
*   **Key Logic:** Loads variables from a `.env` file and the environment, ensuring that secrets are not hardcoded.

### 3.2. Component: Orchestration Service (`main.py`)
*   **Responsibility:** To control the overall execution flow of the application. It acts as the "main" routine.
*   **Technology:** Python.
*   **Interface:** The main entry point of the application.
*   **Key Logic:** Initializes all other services and calls them in the correct sequence: `State Manager` -> `Source Connector` -> `Transformation Service` -> `Destination Connector` -> `State Manager`.

### 3.3. Component: Source Connector (e.g., `SalesforcePoller`)
*   **Responsibility:** To connect to the source system (Salesforce) and extract the required data.
*   **Technology:** Python `requests`, `requests-oauthlib`.
*   **Interface:** A `get_new_records(since_timestamp)` method that returns a list of records.
*   **Key Logic:** Handles authentication with the source API, constructs the appropriate query, and fetches data.

### 3.4. Component: Transformation Service (`transformer.py`)
*   **Responsibility:** To convert the data from the source system's format to the destination system's format.
*   **Technology:** Python.
*   **Interface:** A `transform(source_record)` method that returns a transformed record.
*   **Key Logic:** Implements the specific field mappings and business logic defined in `03_specifications/data_model.md`.

### 3.5. Component: Destination Connector (e.g., `NetSuiteLoader`)
*   **Responsibility:** To connect to the destination system (NetSuite) and load the transformed data.
*   **Technology:** Python `requests`.
*   **Interface:** A `load_record(transformed_record)` method.
*   **Key Logic:** Handles authentication (TBA), formats the final API request, and posts the data to the destination API.

### 3.6. Component: State Manager
*   **Responsibility:** To persist and retrieve the application's state between runs, specifically the timestamp of the last successful run.
*   **Technology:** Python file I/O.
*   **Interface:** `get_last_run_timestamp()` and `set_last_run_timestamp(timestamp)` methods.
*   **Key Logic:** Reads from and writes to a local state file (e.g., `run_state.json`).

### 3.7. Component: Logging Service
*   **Responsibility:** To provide a centralized and configurable logging mechanism.
*   **Technology:** Python's standard `logging` library.
*   **Interface:** A standard logger instance available to all components.
*   **Key Logic:** Configured via a `logging.ini` file to output to both the console and a rotating log file.

## 4. Data Flow Architecture
This section describes the end-to-end journey of data through the system.

1.  **Initiation:** The Orchestrator starts the process, triggered by a cron job.
2.  **State Retrieval:** The Orchestrator asks the State Manager for the `last_run_timestamp`.
3.  **Data Extraction:** The Orchestrator passes the `last_run_timestamp` to the Source Connector, which queries the source system for all records created or modified since that time.
4.  **Data Reception:** The Source Connector returns a raw list of source records to the Orchestrator.
5.  **Transformation Loop:** The Orchestrator iterates through each raw record and passes it to the Transformation Service.
6.  **Data Loading:** The Transformation Service returns a transformed record, which the Orchestrator then passes to the Destination Connector. The Destination Connector loads the record into the target system.
7.  **Error Handling:** If any step within the loop fails for a single record, the error is logged, and the process continues with the next record.
8.  **State Update:** After the loop is complete, if the run was successful, the Orchestrator gets the current timestamp and tells the State Manager to persist it as the new `last_run_timestamp`.

## 5. Key Design Decisions

| Decision Area | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Management** | Use a local JSON file to store the last run timestamp. | Simple, no external dependencies, and sufficient for this project's needs. | - **Database:** Overkill for storing a single value.<br>- **Cloud Storage:** Adds unnecessary complexity and dependencies. |
| **Scheduling** | Use a system-level cron job to trigger the main script. | Highly reliable, industry-standard, and decouples scheduling from the application logic itself. | - **In-app Scheduler (e.g., `apscheduler`):** Tightly couples the app to the scheduling logic, making it stateful and harder to test. |
| **Authentication** | Implement TBA and OAuth logic directly using the `requests` library. | Provides a deeper understanding of the authentication protocols, which is a key learning objective. | - **Using a pre-built SDK:** Hides the complexity of the authentication flow, which would defeat the learning purpose. |

## 6. Error Handling and Resilience
*   **Record-Level Errors:** Failures to process a single record (e.g., due to a data validation error) will be logged in detail, but will not stop the entire run. The process will continue with the next record.
*   **System-Level Errors:** Critical failures (e.g., inability to connect to an API, invalid credentials) will cause the entire run to fail immediately.
*   **Retries:** The system will implement a simple retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient network errors or API rate limit responses (`429` status code).
*   **Idempotency:** The use of `externalId` ensures that if a run is repeated, it will not create duplicate records in the destination system.

---

## 7. Security Design
*   **Credential Storage:** All API credentials and secrets will be stored in a `.env` file, which is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
*   **Data in Transit:** All API communications will use HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted.
*   **Log Security:** No sensitive data (credentials, tokens) will be written to the log files.
