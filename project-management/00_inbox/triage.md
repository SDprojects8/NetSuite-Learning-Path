**Subject:** Initial Triage of NetSuite Learning Path Project

## 1. Objective

This document contains the initial assessment of the information gathered to create a structured learning path for becoming a NetSuite Technical ERP Solutions Architect. The goal is to prioritize tasks and establish a clear direction based on the provided job description and AI-generated learning plans.

## 2. Input Documents Analyzed

*   `data/external/Job_Description.txt`: Defines the target skillset and the end-goal of this learning project.
*   `data/external/GenAi_reponse_filtered.md`: Provides multiple structured learning paths and suggestions for leveraging existing skills.

## 3. Key Findings & Priorities

The job description is heavily focused on technical, hands-on skills. The AI-generated content provides a consensus on the learning order. Based on this, the following priorities have been established:

### Priority 0: Critical Path

*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** This is the absolute prerequisite for SuiteScript. Must be the first technical skill to focus on.
*   **SuiteScript 2.x:** The core requirement of the role. This is the biggest knowledge gap and requires the most dedicated learning time. Understanding User Event, Client, Scheduled, and Map/Reduce scripts is essential.

### Priority 1: High Priority

*   **NetSuite Functional Fundamentals:** It's impossible to develop effectively without understanding the context. Learning the basics of Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay is crucial.
*   **SuiteTalk (REST/SOAP APIs):** A primary responsibility of the architect role is integration. Hands-on practice with Postman against a NetSuite instance is required.
*   **Data Migration Strategies:** The role explicitly calls for experience with CSV imports and API-based data loading.

### Priority 2: Medium Priority

*   **Declarative Tools (SuiteBuilder, SuiteFlow):** Understanding the low-code/no-code capabilities is important to know when *not* to write code. This is a foundational administrator skill.
*   **SuiteCloud Development Framework (SDF):** This is the key to applying modern DevOps practices. Given existing experience with CI/CD and Git, this should be relatively straightforward to learn, but it is essential for a senior role.

## 4. Immediate Action Items

1.  **Structure the Roadmap:** The high-level roadmap generated for the `README.md` should be used as the primary source for initial planning documents.
2.  **Populate Inbox:**
    *   Move the roadmap phases into `00_inbox/backlog.md` as high-level epics.
    *   List the portfolio project ideas in `00_inbox/ideas.md`.
3.  **Populate Planning Documents:**
    *   Use the `README.md` content to create an initial version of the `04_planning/roadmap.md`.
    *   Break down the first phase of the roadmap into smaller tasks in `04_planning/WBS.md`.
4.  **Begin Phase 1 Research:** Start gathering specific learning resources (courses, tutorials, documentation) for JavaScript ES6+ and NetSuite Functional Fundamentals.
