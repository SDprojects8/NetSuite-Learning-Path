### Discussion & Key Decisions

#### 1. Project Goal
*   The undisputed goal is to acquire the skills necessary to qualify for the **Technical ERP Solutions Architect** role as defined in `data/external/Job_Description.txt`.
*   Success is measured by the ability to confidently perform the key responsibilities and meet the technical skill requirements listed in the job description.
*   This is not just a theoretical exercise; the end goal is job-readiness.

#### 2. Source Material Analysis
*   The `Job_Description.txt` is the primary requirements document. Key skills identified are: SuiteScript, SuiteTalk (APIs), SuiteCloud Development Framework (SDF), data migration, and integration architecture.
*   The `GenAi_reponse_filtered.md` file provides a strong consensus on a structured learning path. The multiple AI sources agree on the general progression from functional understanding to development, integration, and finally DevOps.
*   The recommendation to leverage existing skills (Python, DevOps, Oracle DB knowledge) is a key strategic advantage and will be incorporated into the plan.

#### 3. High-Level Roadmap
*   A 5-phase roadmap was agreed upon, as it provides a logical progression from foundational knowledge to advanced, real-world application.
*   **The 5 Phases:**
    1.  **Phase 1: Foundation (Functional & Admin):** Understand what the system does before trying to code it.
    2.  **Phase 2: Core Development (SuiteScript):** The most critical phase, covering the primary technical skill gap.
    3.  **Phase 3: Integration (SuiteTalk):** Focus on connecting NetSuite to the outside world.
    4.  **Phase 4: DevOps (SDF):** Apply modern development practices to NetSuite.
    5.  **Phase 5: Advanced Architecture & Portfolio Building:** Synthesize all skills into practical projects.
*   This roadmap will be documented in the root `README.md` file to serve as the master plan.

#### 4. Portfolio Projects
*   It was decided that the project must result in a portfolio of tangible work.
*   The ideas brainstormed (Integration Hub, Data Migration Tool, CI/CD Pipeline, etc.) are excellent candidates and will be captured in `00_inbox/ideas.md`. These projects directly map to the skills required in the job description.
