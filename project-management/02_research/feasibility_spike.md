# Feasibility Spike Report

## Purpose
This document outlines the plan, execution, and findings of a time-boxed technical investigation (a "spike") to determine the feasibility of a specific approach, technology, or implementation strategy. The goal is to reduce risk and uncertainty before committing to a full-scale development effort.

---

## Spike: [Spike Name - e.g., "CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for SDF"]

### 1. Objective & Research Question
*   **Objective:** To determine the viability and complexity of [describe the goal].
*   **Primary Question(s):** Can we [achieve a specific technical outcome]? What are the limitations of [a specific tool or API]? How long would it take to build a proof-of-concept for [a specific feature]?

---

### 2. Hypothesis
*   **We believe that:** [State the assumption you are testing. e.g., "We believe that it is possible to fully automate the deployment of an SDF project to a NetSuite sandbox using only GitHub Actions and the SDF CLI."]
*   **This will be confirmed if:** [State the specific, measurable success criteria. e.g., "We can successfully deploy a custom field and a SuiteScript file from a Git push to the `main` branch without any manual intervention."]

---

### 3. Timebox
*   **Start Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
*   **End Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
*   **Duration:** [e.g., 2 days, 8 hours]
*   **Constraint:** The investigation must stop at the end of the timebox, regardless of completion. The goal is learning, not a perfect, production-ready solution.

---

### 4. Methodology
*This section outlines the steps that will be taken during the spike.*

1.  **Setup:** [e.g., Install SDF CLI on a test runner, configure authentication secrets in GitHub.]
2.  **Step 1:** [e.g., Create a basic SDF project with one custom field.]
3.  **Step 2:** [e.g., Write a simple GitHub Actions workflow file that triggers on push.]
4.  **Step 3:** [e.g., Add a script step to execute the `sdfcli deploy` command.]
5.  **Step 4:** [e.g., Test the deployment and troubleshoot any authentication or configuration issues.]
6.  **Documentation:** Document all findings, errors, and workarounds.

---

### 5. Findings & Results
*This section is filled out **after** the spike is completed.*

*   **Outcome:** [Success / Partial Success / Failure]
*   **Key Finding 1:** [e.g., "Authentication using NetSuite's TBA was successful, but required creating a custom script to handle the token generation as the standard GitHub Action for this was insufficient."]
*   **Key Finding 2:** [e.g., "The deployment of the custom field worked flawlessly."]
*   **Key Finding 3:** [e.g., "A major challenge was encountered when... This required the following workaround..."]
*   **Code/Configuration Snippets:**
    ```yaml
    # Post any relevant code, scripts, or configuration examples here
    # that were produced during the spike.
    ```
*   **Errors Encountered:**
    *   `Error Code XYZ`: This occurred because... The solution was...

### 6. Conclusion & Recommendation

*   **Was the hypothesis confirmed?** [Yes/No/Partially]
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** [Feasible / Feasible with Conditions / Not Feasible]
*   **Summary:** [Provide a brief summary of the conclusion. e.g., "The proposed approach of using GitHub Actions for SDF deployment is feasible. However, it requires a custom scripting component for authentication that adds approximately 4 hours of initial setup time to any new project."]
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   [ ] **Proceed:** We should proceed with this approach for the main project.
    *   [ ] **Proceed with Caution:** We should proceed, but we need to allocate extra time for [the identified challenges].
    *   [ ] **Re-evaluate:** The approach is not feasible as is. We need to investigate alternatives, such as [alternative idea].
    *   [ ] **Abandon:** This approach is not viable.

### 7. Risks & Open Questions
*This section lists any new risks or unanswered questions discovered during the spike.*

*   **Risk 1:** [e.g., "The custom authentication script creates a dependency that will need to be maintained."]
*   **Risk 2:** [e.g., "The performance of the deployment for a large project with hundreds of objects is still unknown."]
*   **Open Question 1:** [e.g., "How will we handle rollbacks in an automated fashion?"]
