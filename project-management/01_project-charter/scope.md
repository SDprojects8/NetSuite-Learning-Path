## 4. Out-of-Scope Items

To maintain focus and ensure timely completion, the following items are explicitly **EXCLUDED** from the project scope:

*   **Deep Functional Consulting:** The project will not cover the deep functional configuration of specialized modules like NetSuite WMS, Manufacturing, or SuiteBilling. The focus is technical architecture, not functional consulting.
*   **Third-Party SuiteApp Development:** The project will not involve building a commercial SuiteApp for the SuiteApp marketplace.
*   **NetSuite Account Provisioning and Licensing:** The process of acquiring or paying for a NetSuite account is outside the scope of this learning project. The scope begins with the assumption that an account is available.
*   **Learning Unrelated Technologies:** The project will not include in-depth learning of technologies not directly applicable to the portfolio projects or the target job description (e.g., learning a new front-end framework like React or Vue).
*   **Job Application and Interviewing Process:** While the project's goal is job readiness, the activities of searching for jobs, applying, and interviewing are post-project activities and are not included in the scope.

---

## 5. Project Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered complete and successful when:

*   All 5 portfolio projects are completed, functional, and documented in a public Git repository.
*   Both the `SuiteFoundation` and `SuiteCloud Developer II` certifications have been successfully obtained.
*   The learner can confidently explain and answer technical questions related to every "Required Technical Skill" listed in the `Job_Description.txt` file.
*   All project deliverables listed in Section 2 are finalized and meet a high standard of quality.

---

## 6. Scope Constraints and Assumptions

*   **Constraint:** All work must be completed within the 4-month timeline defined in the project roadmap.
*   **Constraint:** The project budget for all training materials and certifications is limited to [Amount].
*   **Assumption:** A NetSuite development or sandbox account will be accessible for the duration of the project.
*   **Assumption:** The core requirements of the target role will not change significantly during the project's timeline.
