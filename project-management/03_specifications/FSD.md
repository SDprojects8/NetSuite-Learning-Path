## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document provides the detailed functional requirements for the "[Project Name]" portfolio project. It describes the features, capabilities, and user interactions that will define the system. This FSD serves as the primary reference for project development and testing, ensuring the final product meets the intended goals.

### 1.2. Project Scope and Objectives
The objective of this project is to [briefly describe the project's goal, e.g., "create a middleware service to synchronize customer data between NetSuite and Salesforce"]. This system will demonstrate proficiency in [list key skills, e.g., "SuiteTalk API integration, authentication, and data transformation"].

The scope is limited to the functionalities described in this document. Anything not explicitly mentioned is considered out of scope.

### 1.3. Intended Audience
This document is intended for:
*   **Project Developer (Self):** As a guide for implementation.
*   **Reviewers/Mentors:** To understand the project's functionality and provide feedback.
*   **Potential Employers:** To showcase the ability to define and document a technical solution.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1. General Description
The [Project Name] is a [describe the system, e.g., "a Python-based application that runs on a schedule to poll for changes in System A and push them to System B"]. It will handle [main function, e.g., "the creation and updating of customer records"] between the two platforms, ensuring data consistency.

### 2.2. User Personas and Roles
| Persona | Description | Responsibilities / Interactions |
|---|---|---|
| **Integration Administrator** | The user responsible for configuring, running, and monitoring the integration. | - Sets up credentials.<br>- Manages execution schedules.<br>- Reviews logs for errors. |
| **System User** | (Indirect) A user of the source or destination system (e.g., Salesforce or NetSuite). | - Creates/updates data that triggers the integration. |

## 3. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 3.1. Assumptions
*   The system will have network access to the APIs of all connected systems.
*   The data schemas of the source and destination systems are stable.

### 3.2. Dependencies
*   Requires valid API credentials (e.g., NetSuite TBA tokens, Salesforce OAuth credentials) to be provided in a secure configuration file.
*   Depends on the availability of the NetSuite and Salesforce APIs.

## 4. Functional Requirements

This section details the system's features, broken down into user stories.

### 4.1. Feature: Customer Data Synchronization

#### 4.1.1. User Story: F-001 - Create NetSuite Customer from New Salesforce Account
*   **As an** Integration Administrator,
*   **I want** the system to automatically create a new Customer record in NetSuite when a new Account is created in Salesforce,
*   **so that** I don't have to perform manual data entry and our systems stay in sync.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  When an "Account" of type "Customer" is created in Salesforce, a corresponding "Customer" record must be created in NetSuite within 5 minutes.
    2.  The NetSuite Customer's `externalId` must be set to the Salesforce Account's `Id`.
    3.  A success message containing the Salesforce ID and the new NetSuite internal ID is written to the log file.
    4.  If the creation in NetSuite fails, an error must be logged with a clear reason, and the Salesforce Account should be marked for retry.
*   **Business Rules:**
    *   Only Accounts with `Type` = "Customer - Direct" will be synchronized.
    *   The default subsidiary in NetSuite should be "USA".

#### 4.1.2. User Story: F-002 - Update NetSuite Customer from Salesforce Account Update
*   **As an** Integration Administrator,
*   **I want** the system to update the corresponding Customer record in NetSuite when a mapped field on a Salesforce Account is updated,
*   **so that** changes to customer information are reflected in both systems.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  When the `Phone` or `Website` field is updated on a Salesforce Account, the corresponding fields on the linked NetSuite Customer are updated within 5 minutes.
    2.  The system correctly identifies the NetSuite customer using the `externalId`.
    3.  A success message is logged.
    4.  If the NetSuite customer is not found, a warning is logged.

## 5. Use Case Specification

### 5.1. Use Case: UC-001 - Synchronize a New Account

*   **Actors:** Integration Service, Salesforce API, NetSuite API
*   **Description:** This use case describes the process of creating a NetSuite Customer from a newly created Salesforce Account.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The service is running.
    *   Valid credentials for both systems are configured.
    *   A new Account that meets the sync criteria has been created in Salesforce since the last run.
*   **Postconditions:**
    *   A new Customer record exists in NetSuite.
    *   The execution log is updated.
*   **Main Flow (Happy Path):**
    1.  The Integration Service polls Salesforce for newly created Accounts since the last successful execution time.
    2.  Salesforce API returns a list of new Accounts.
    3.  For each Account, the service checks if it meets the synchronization criteria (`Type` = "Customer - Direct").
    4.  The service constructs a NetSuite Customer record payload, mapping the fields as defined in the data dictionary.
    5.  The service submits a `POST` request to the NetSuite API to create the new Customer.
    6.  The NetSuite API returns a success response with the new Customer's internal ID.
    7.  The service logs the successful creation.
    8.  The service updates its internal state with the new last successful execution time.
*   **Alternative Flows & Exceptions:**
    *   **A1: No new accounts found.** The service logs a "No new records to process" message and finishes.
    *   **E1: NetSuite API returns an error (e.g., validation failure).** The service catches the exception, logs a detailed error message including the Salesforce ID and the error response from NetSuite, and moves to the next record.
    *   **E2: Salesforce API is unavailable.** The service logs a critical error and terminates the run, to be retried on the next schedule.

## 6. Data Requirements

### 6.1. Data Field Mappings
The following table defines the field mappings for the Account-to-Customer synchronization.

| Source System | Source Field | Data Type | Destination System | Destination Field | Transformation/Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Salesforce | `Id` | `string` | NetSuite | `externalId` | Direct map. Required. |
| Salesforce | `Name` | `string` | NetSuite | `companyName` | Direct map. Required. |
| Salesforce | `Phone` | `phone` | NetSuite | `phone` | Direct map. |
| Salesforce | `Website` | `url` | NetSuite | `url` | Direct map. |
| (Constant) | N/A | `string` | NetSuite | `subsidiary` | Hardcoded to "USA". |
