## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document defines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the "[Project Name]" project. NFRs specify the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the system, complementing the functional requirements (which define *what* the system does). These requirements ensure the system is performant, secure, reliable, and maintainable.

### 1.2. Scope
The NFRs listed here apply to all components of the [Project Name] system, including the core application, its integrations, and any related processes.

### 1.3. Intended Audience
*   **Project Developer (Self):** To ensure the system is built to meet these quality standards.
*   **Technical Reviewers/Mentors:** To evaluate the architectural soundness of the project.
*   **Potential Employers:** To demonstrate an understanding of enterprise-grade system qualities beyond basic functionality.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

This section details the specific NFRs, categorized by quality attribute. Each requirement is given a unique identifier (e.g., PERF-01) for traceability.

### 2.1. Performance
Performance requirements define how quickly and efficiently the system must operate under specific conditions.

| ID | Requirement | Metric | Target | How to Measure | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PERF-01** | **Data Processing Throughput** | The system must be able to process a batch of records from the source system. | Process 1,000 records in under 5 minutes. | Time the execution of a test run with a dataset of 1,000 records. | High |
| **PERF-02** | **API Response Time** | External API calls made by the system should not exceed a specific duration. | 95% of API calls to external systems (NetSuite, Salesforce) must complete in under 2 seconds. | Measure the duration of each API call and analyze the 95th percentile from application logs. | Medium |
| **PERF-03** | **Resource Utilization** | The application should not consume excessive system resources. | CPU utilization should not exceed 80% for more than 1 minute. Memory usage should remain below 500 MB. | Monitor the process using standard OS tools (`top`, `htop`, Task Manager) during a full test run. | High |

### 2.2. Reliability and Availability
Reliability and Availability requirements focus on the system's uptime and its ability to operate without failure.

| ID | Requirement | Metric | Target | How to Measure | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REL-01** | **Availability** | The system must be available to run on its defined schedule. | 99.9% uptime. (For this project, this means no more than one missed scheduled run per 1,000 runs). | Review execution logs and cron job history over a one-week period. | High |
| **REL-02** | **Error Rate** | The rate of unhandled exceptions or crashes during a run. | Less than 0.1% of processed records should result in an unhandled exception. | Analyze application logs for stack traces and unhandled errors. | High |
| **REL-03** | **Mean Time To Recover (MTTR)** | The time it takes to restore the service after a failure. | The application should be restartable within 2 minutes of a crash (manual restart). | Simulate a failure and time the manual restart process. | Medium |
| **REL-04** | **Data Integrity** | The system must not corrupt or lose data during processing. | 100% of successfully processed records in the source system must match the corresponding records in the destination system. | Perform a data audit on a sample of 100 records, comparing source and destination fields. | Critical |

### 2.3. Security
Security requirements define how the system protects against threats and vulnerabilities.

| ID | Requirement | Metric | Target | How to Measure | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEC-01** | **Credentials Management** | API keys, tokens, and other secrets must not be stored in plaintext in the codebase. | No secrets present in any file committed to the Git repository. | Code review and static analysis of the Git repository. The `.gitignore` file must list the credentials file (e.g., `.env`). | Critical |
| **SEC-02** | **Secure Communication** | All data transmitted to external APIs must be encrypted. | All API communication must use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher). | Code review to ensure all API endpoints use `https://`. | Critical |
| **SEC-03** | **Log Sanitization** | Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) must not be written to log files. | No sensitive data is present in `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `ERROR` logs. | Review log outputs during a full test run, including error scenarios. | High |
| **SEC-04** | **Dependency Security** | All third-party libraries used must be free from known critical vulnerabilities. | 0 critical vulnerabilities reported by a dependency scanning tool (e.g., `pip-audit`, GitHub Dependabot). | Run a dependency scan against the `requirements.txt` file. | High |

### 2.4. Maintainability
Maintainability requirements ensure the system is easy to modify, test, and debug.

| ID | Requirement | Metric | Target | How to Measure | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MAIN-01** | **Code Quality** | The code must adhere to defined coding standards. | The codebase must pass a linter (e.g., `flake8` or `black` for Python) with zero violations. | Run the linter as part of a pre-commit hook or CI check. | High |
| **MAIN-02** | **Code Documentation** | All public functions, classes, and complex logic blocks must be documented. | 100% of public functions and classes have clear docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. | Manual code review. | Medium |
| **MAIN-03** | **Configurability** | Environment-specific settings must be externalized from the code. | All connection details, endpoints, and credentials must be configurable via a `.env` file or environment variables. | Code review to ensure no hardcoded configuration values exist. | High |
| **MAIN-04** | **Test Coverage** | Key business logic must be covered by automated tests. | Unit tests must cover at least 80% of the core transformation and connector logic. | Measure code coverage using a tool like `pytest-cov`. | Medium |

### 2.5. Usability (for Administrators)
Usability requirements define how easy the system is to operate and monitor.

| ID | Requirement | Metric | Target | How to Measure | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **USE-01** | **Clarity of Logs** | Log messages must be clear and actionable for an administrator. | An administrator can determine the status of a run (success, failure, number of records processed) solely by reading the `INFO` level logs. | Review the log file from a sample run and assess its clarity. | High |
| **USE-02** | **Ease of Deployment** | The application should be deployable with a minimal number of steps. | An administrator can set up and run the application on a new machine in under 15 minutes by following the `README.md`. | Time the setup process on a clean environment. | Medium |
